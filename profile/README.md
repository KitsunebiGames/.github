## Projects
 * [Inochi2D](https://inochi2d.com)  
   I am the lead developer of Inochi2D and have an intimate understanding of its structure and tools and can adapt it to the needs of your game production pipeline.

 * [Dead Pets Unleashed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851720/Dead_Pets_Unleashed/) (Triple Topping, prior)  
     As an intern I developed tools for analytics and gameplay for Dead Pets Unleashed using C# and Unity.  
     I also developed some smaller gameplay components and have experience with Wwise and Unity's audio engine.
   * I additionally have helped with providing input on getting Triple Topping's other games running smoothly on Linux/Steam Deck.
